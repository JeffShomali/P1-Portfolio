# My Portfolio Website
This is my personal website. I built it from scratch. As I took some design course such as Sketch, I mockup this website as my hobby. I convert the whole mockup to HTML and CSS. Basically, I used HTML5, CSS3, and Twitter Bootstrap. But I made it full responsive with any type of device. In fact, all the images and text are also responsive.

In the left pallet of a website, you can see all project I have done recently. By clicking on them, you can run the APP.

# Technology
This is static version of my website and only included basic files, but in my personal website I translated this version into dynamic version and used some additional technology like `PHP`, `Javascript` and `Twitter API`.


This is the screenshot of my PHP version website:
